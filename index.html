                <div class="aboutme">
                    <p>My name is Wendy Kariuki. I was born and breed in the central side of Kenya, on the Mt. Kenya region. I am the first born in a family of 2.
                        I have one sisterwho is six years younger than I am. I went to school at 3 years old and I grew to be a very responsible lady. I went to 
                        Sunday School every Sunday. My hobby as a kid was playing games especially hide and seek. I went to boarding school at 12years old. I did
                        not like this experience much because I always missed home. I eventually got used to it anyway. I went to high at 14years in Nyeri county.
                        I later finished my high school and joined campus where i graduated with  a Bachelors degree in Economics and Finance. I have developed a 
                        very immense passion for tech and my dream is to become the very best in this field. One word to describe me is enthuthiastic. I'm extremely 
                        passionate in whatever I do and I'm keen to always get things done. I am a very self-aware person and I know and understand what I stand for.
                        Coming to Moringa has been a very great opportunity for me becuse i know this is where my dreams come true.
